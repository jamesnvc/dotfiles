Dotfiles
========

This is a collection of my various configuration files.  I primarily use them on OS X, but they should work with only a few modifications on Linux as well.

Vim Configuration
======

To use the vim stuff here, do a `git submodule init`, `git submodule update`, then symlink vimrc to ~/.vimrc and vim to ~/.vim.
