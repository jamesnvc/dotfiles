 Hi James,

This might be feasible or not, depending on a lot of things. Namely, my
hosts want to rent the room pretty much asap. So if someone shows up
that will be intending to come significantly earlier than you, they
might prefer him to you, which is understandable. Adding Melissa to CC
so that you can communicate the possible details together.
