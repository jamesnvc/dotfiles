Subject: Ride overnight stay

For the overnight stay, there are tents that we can stay in (it's 2 people
per tent and apparently they're the 4-person ones). Otherwise, you can opt
to stay in a hotel/ McMaster university dorm, which you have to pay out of
your own pocket.

The orientation actually covered a lot of info... you should try to go to
one if you plan on doing the ride.
