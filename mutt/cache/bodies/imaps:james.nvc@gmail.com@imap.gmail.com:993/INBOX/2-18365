Super Crunchers
Oliver Chiang, 03.14.11, 6:00 PM ET
Forbes.com<http://Forbes.com>
http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0314/technology-facebook-palantir-thinkpr=
ogress-super-crunchers_print.html

For a software firm that prides itself on discretion, this was no way to ma=
ke a splash. Palantir Technologies in Palo Alto, Calif. had to apologize in=
 mid-February for having its name on a proposed collaboration to sabotage t=
he website of WikiLeaks on behalf of its rumored target, Bank of America. T=
he hacker collective Anonymous had uncovered the Palantir connection when i=
t nabbed e-mails from security firm HBGary Federal. The leaked e-mails also=
 showed a similar plan of attack against pro-labor website ThinkProgress on=
 behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Palantir's 43-year-old chief executive, Alex Karp, issued a public apology =
over the HBGary flap and severed all ties with that firm. "Even if we wante=
d to, it would take us years to build offensive capabilities. That's pretty=
 far outside the realm of what we do," says Karp.

What Palantir does do is hire young computer scientists from elite universi=
ties to create highly sophisticated data-sifting and visualization tools th=
at help three-letter government agencies, banks and other organizations con=
duct cybersecurity, counterterrorism and fraud detection. But a company of =
27-year-old cybersleuths can yield loose-cannon behavior. The young enginee=
r responsible for putting Palantir's name on the proposal slides is now "on=
 leave" while the company conducts an investigation.

"We want to be more careful about making sure our name doesn't go on propos=
als that are other people's ideas," says Karp.

Despite his apologies, the WikiLeaks flap "is seriously damaging their repu=
tation on campus," says Jake Becker, a third-year computer science student =
at Stanford, who has friends and classmates who work at the company.

Eventually this mess will subside, leaving Palantir to resume its mission o=
f saving the world from evildoers. That is not a joke. Its engineers are al=
l called Forward Deployed Engineers, and several walk around in "Save the S=
hire" T-shirts, a nod to J.R.R. Tolkien's heroic hobbits. (The Palantir wer=
e seeing-stones used by wizards in the Lord of the Rings.)

Its software's secret sauce is its ability to assimilate incredibly large a=
mounts of data (up to a million gigabytes' worth in some cases) from dispar=
ate databases and allow investigators to apply different functions to it su=
ch as mapping, filtering, timelines and search. A point-and-click interface=
 allows enforcement officials to sift through it using language they unders=
tand, such as "fraudster" and "suspicious account."

Since its founding six years ago Palantir has been quickly expanding its cu=
stomer base in Washington and the financial services industry. Its software=
 aided in uncovering information about Syrian suicide-bombing networks in I=
raq and spotting abuse of stimulus funds on behalf of the Recovery Accounta=
bility & Transparency Board.

JPMorgan Chase Chief Information Officer Guy Chiarello says the Palantir so=
ftware has improved the bank's ability to detect fraud even before it occur=
s. He calls Palantir "the best bet I've made in quite a while," and signed =
a multiyear contract in December 2009 in the $5 million-to-$20 million rang=
e.

Palantir doesn't disclose revenue, saying only that revenue has been tripli=
ng every year since 2008. A highly reputable source familiar with the compa=
ny who did not wish to be named said revenue was significantly north of $80=
 million. Karp says that his firm became cash-flow positive in 2010.

Karp cofounded Palantir with several other Stanford computer scientists and=
 members of the PayPal mafia. The most prominent of these was Peter Thiel, =
the billionaire Facebook investor. In 2003 Thiel pitched Karp, a former Sta=
nford Law School buddy, on the idea of developing PayPal's antifraud techno=
logy into a tool that could help fight terrorism. Thiel chose Karp, who hol=
ds a Ph.D. in German social philosophy from the University of Frankfurt, be=
cause of his "genuine open-mindedness" and nonconformism. (Karp never learn=
ed how to drive a car because he "had other things to do," says Thiel.)

Karp was enthusiastic about the idea. Investors were not. Thiel's Founders =
Fund led an initial $12 million funding round in 2006. Some $2 million of t=
hat came from the CIA's venture fund In-Q-Tel. In mid-2008 Palantir raised =
another $40 million led by Founders Fund. A third round of $90 million clos=
ed over the summer at a $735 million valuation.

Thiel, Palantir's largest investor, thinks the company is on track to be th=
e next Facebook or Google. "It should be worth on the order of tens of bill=
ions in a few years' time," Thiel croons. Karp sees a "clear path" to $1 bi=
llion in revenue in five years.

Likely? Definitely more so than your getting a job there, unless you can an=
swer interview questions like this one: Given an N-by-M grid filled with po=
sitive numbers, write a program to find the path from top left to bottom ri=
ght that minimizes the sum of all numbers you walk on. If you can answer th=
at, welcome to nerdtopia. Palantir's offices have snacks, Nerf guns, Settle=
rs of Catan game boards and a daily game of Halo at 6 p.m.

Others aren't as bullish on Palantir's billion-dollar ambitions. Gartner an=
alyst John Pescatore says the market for "situational awareness tools" like=
 Palantir's is in the tens of millions of dollars, a fraction of the overal=
l security intelligence services' budgets, which are dominated by the likes=
 of Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed Martin. IBM is also a competitor here.

Dave Kellogg, former chief executive of business intelligence software make=
r MarkLogic, thinks Palantir's big fundraising rounds are the sort of "go b=
ig or go home" strategy that PayPal used to win the market. "My issue with =
Palantir is that I don't see a landgrab market opportunity," he wrote in a =
blog post last April.

Palantir's customers, however, rave. Montgomery Meigs, a retired U.S. Army =
general who gave Palantir one of its first contracts back in 2006 with the =
Joint IED Defeat Organization, calls Palantir a "rare sort of company," who=
se creative and innovative work was "absolutely instrumental" to some of th=
e organization's efforts. Chiarello says, "I work with the best companies i=
n the world. I don't say this lightly: This is a very good group of people.=
"

Karp and Thiel say the greatest problem they've solved with their software =
is its ability to fight terrorism and global violence while retaining civil=
 liberties. Information in its workflow is tagged so that users can access =
only the data they're cleared to see.

Still, it's surprising that the ultralibertarian Thiel is so strongly backi=
ng a company that gives the government such a powerful tool. Thiel hedges a=
 bit: "I believe, as a libertarian, that if the security problem is not sol=
ved, we will end up with a society with terrorism and no civil liberties at=
 all."
